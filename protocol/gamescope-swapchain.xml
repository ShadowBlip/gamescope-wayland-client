        Xwayland creates a wl_surface for each X11 window. It sends a
        WL_SURFACE_ID client message to indicate the mapping between the X11
        windows and the wl_surface objects.

        This request overrides this mapping for a given X11 window, allowing an
        X11 client to submit buffers via the Wayland protocol. The override
        only affects buffer submission. Everything else (e.g. input events)
        still uses Xwayland's WL_SURFACE_ID.

        x11_server is gotten by the GAMESCOPE_XWAYLAND_SERVER_ID property on the
        root window of the associated server.

        Provide swapchain feedback to the compositor.

        This is what the useless tearing protocol should have been.
        Absolutely not enough information in the final protocol to do what we want for SteamOS --
        which is have the Allow Tearing toggle apply to *both* Mailbox + Immediate and NOT fifo,
        essentially acting as an override for tearing on/off for games.
        The upstream protocol is very useless for our usecase here.

        Provides image count ahead of time instead of needing to try and calculate it from
        an initial stall if we are doing low latency.

        Provides colorspace info for us to do HDR for both HDR10 PQ and scRGB.
        The upstream HDR efforts seem to have no interest in supporting scRGB but we *need* that so /shrug
        We can do it here now! Yipee!

        Swapchain feedback solves so many problems! :D
