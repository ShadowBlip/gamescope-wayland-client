  <description summary="gamescope-specific xwayland protocol">
    This is a private Gamescope protocol. Regular Wayland clients must not use
    it.

    This protocol has been superceded by the 'gamescope-swapchain' protocol.

    <request name="override_window_content">
      <description summary="override an X11's window wl_surface">
        Xwayland creates a wl_surface for each X11 window. It sends a
        WL_SURFACE_ID client message to indicate the mapping between the X11
        windows and the wl_surface objects.

        This request overrides this mapping for a given X11 window, allowing an
        X11 client to submit buffers via the Wayland protocol. The override
        only affects buffer submission. Everything else (e.g. input events)
        still uses Xwayland's WL_SURFACE_ID.

        x11_server is gotten by the GAMESCOPE_XWAYLAND_SERVER_ID property on the
        root window of the associated server.
